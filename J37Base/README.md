# Base for J-37 Straight Key

This is a base for a J-37 straight key.

## Required hardware

* M3 x D4.6 x L5.0 heat set threaded insert (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000232858343.html) - 5X
* M3x12 socket head cap screw - 5X
* #6x1/2" flat head screw - 3X
* Heavy material to fill the base - I used fine lead shot.

## Print settings:
* 0.2mm layer height
* 5 perimeters
* No support
* 10% gyroid infill

## Instructions:
* Print each section with the biggest flat area down - the STL for the bottom section is upside down from how it should be printed.
* Punch through the sacrificial layers in the screw holes in the bottom section
* Install the heat set inserts into the 5 holes in the top section.
* Fill the top section with some heavy material like lead shot.
* Screw the bottom into the top with the M3x12 screws.
* Screw the J-37 onto the base by using the #6x1/2" screws _from the bottom_.
* Add some sort of padding to the bottom to avoid damaging any surface it rests on. I used thin craft foam attached with permanent double sided tape.
